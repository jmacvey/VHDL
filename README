This project contains source code which implements and tests a MIPS32 single-
cycle processor.  The two sub-directories are mips_components and display_modules.  These are associated as such so that anyone may simply download them as libraries and write their own top-modules for implementation via port mapping.  "mips_components" contains the primary modules for the processor (Fetch, Decode, Execute). Control and memory modules were written by another person who wishes their code is not contained in a public repository.  However, you may e-mail me with requests for that code, and I can forward you to them.  Display modules are convenient for testing purposes (e.g. bit-tracking via terminals on manually-clocked processor, addresses on SSD module).  Any questions don't hesitate to e-mail.  Thanks.
